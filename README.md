# To-Do-List-and-Focus
The language of this project is Python.

The main techniques are: GUI Tinkter, txt file editing and time library

The purpose is to improve the user's concentration ability and orgranizes tasks.

There are two main functions of this program, a focus spans tracker and a to-do list.

It needs to be used with a txt file placed in the same folder as the program.


For the focus spans tracker, it allows the user the set a goal of how many times they want to focus.

Then, the user sets the countdown timer and when time is up, the number of focus spans they have finished adds one.

A message will pop up to inform the user when the goal is completed.


The to-do list contains a listbox that displays the to-do assignments, an entry box to enter new assignments and four buttons: add, complete, delete and load.

"Add" will put the content in the entry box onto the listbox and writes it in a txt file as a new line.

"Complete" disappears the selected assignment in the entry box but doesn't change the txt file.

"Delete" deletes the selected assignment from the listbox and the txt file.

"Load" loads everything from the txt file to listbox.
